Get feature names and subset to only those features of mean or std measures

##Tidy Part 2
Get the train and test feature sets and subset only the desired features

##Tidy Part 3
Combine the two datasets into 1

##Tidy Part 4
Attach column names to features

##Tidy Part 5
Read and combine the train and test activity codes

##Tidy Part 6
Get activity labels and attach to activity codes

##Tidy Part 7
Get and combine the train and test subject ids

##Tidy Part 8
Combine and name subjects and activity names

##Tidy Part 9
Combine with measures of interest for finished desired data frame
