###Getting and Cleaning Data, Peer Assessment Project 

##To repeat the work done in this project:

    1. Download source data from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
    2. Unzip to your working directory
    3. Execute the script run_analysis.R from that directory.

#Tidy Part 1
Get feature names and subset to only those features of mean or std measures

#Tidy Part 2
Get the train and test feature sets and subset only the desired features

#Tidy Part 3
Combine the two datasets into 1

#Tidy Part 4
Attach column names to features

#Tidy Part 5
Read and combine the train and test activity codes

#Tidy Part 6
Get activity labels and attach to activity codes

#Tidy Part 7
Get and combine the train and test subject ids

#Tidy Part 8
Combine and name subjects and activity names

#Tidy Part 9
Combine with measures of interest for finished desired data frame

Compute New Result
From the set produced for analysis, compute and report means of all measures, grouped by subject_id and by activity.
